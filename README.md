# Deep Neural Network optimization for the CIFAR-100

## Overview

This repository, explores the challenges and solutions of training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Unlike the simpler CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 presents a more complex classification task with 100 classes, making it a suitable candidate for deeper models. Wider models typically struggle with this complexity, thus needing the use of deeper architectures. Additionally, we focus solely on DNNs with the goal to achieve above 50% accuracy which is quite difficult without convolutional layers.
